## Guidance

Forms provide a way to collect important data from a user. However, this data is only collected effectively when Forms are built in a way in which users are inclined to fill out in full.

### Usage

Forms don't need to be a tedious task for users to complete, as they often come to be. It is important to ease as much of this effort as possible when building a Form. Making Forms simple to complete leads to increase in form completion.

**Follow these guidelines when creating a Form:**

- Use as few fields as possible
- Wrap all input elements within a FormField
- Fill in default values for as many fields as possible
- Reveal fields progressively so the user is not overwhelmed
- Use clear, concise labels for each field
- Use placeholder text as an added visual indication of expected input value format

### Capitalization in forms

Writing standards contribute to the voice, tone, and grammatical accuracy that inform the experiences we create. These standards are aligned with HPE Brand.

Within a form, you should:

- Use title case and capitalize short prepositions when they are the last word in a sentence (e.g. Sign Up, Sign Out)
- For headings and captions, use sentence case

### Button placement and labeling

Submit, reset, or cancel buttons should always be placed at the bottom of a Form.

Button labels should be specific to the action of the button. For example, a [sign-up form](#sign-up) may have a submit button with label "Sign Up". Alternately, a [password change form](#change-password) may have a button with label "Update Password".

Button label specificity provides users confidence in the action they are performing.


### Accessibility

All Form input elements need to be contained within a FormField.

**FormFields need to have:**

- A "for" property that matches the id of its child input. If using Grommet, this is applied with the htmlFor prop.
- A "name" property applied on both the FormField and its child input element
- A clear, concise label

## Guidance with validation

validation should happen both on formfield level as well as submission of the form. 

### Required vs. optional fields

When possible, restrict Forms only to fields that are required. This ensures that the Form remains concise for the user. However, there may be cases where optional fields may be fitting.

When using a mixture of required and optional fields, apply the "required" prop to any given FormField label in which will disable form submission until this field has been completed.

For standard forms, use an asterisk(*) to indicate required field/controls. 
Optional fields receive no treatment.

Sign In and Sign Up forms do not use an asterisk for required fields. All other standard forms/long forms will use an asterisk for required fields. 

Optional fields receive no treatments.


### Using help & info text

In most cases, the FormField label should be clear enough to instruct the user how to complete a field. However, if help text is required, ensure that it is kept brief and precise.

Help/Info text may be relevant for cases such as [password requirements](#sign-up) or [additional resources](#customize) on a field's context

### Field validation

In most cases field validation is used in order to ensure that the data filled out passes any set paramaters. 

Field validation should be followed with an error message that will help the user understand the problem and will be able to fix it. 

For any required field the following should be used "This is a required field"

Form validation will occur before any api call is made to ensure the correct information is being used.

### Form submission

Visual feedback is important to instill confidence in a user after form submission.

**On submission, your form should:**

- In the case of an error, focus should be placed on the input element where the error occurred.
- Provide user with indication that form was submitted successfully (e.g. notification, success page, etc.)
- Display all relevant errors accompanied by text explaining actions needed to resolve.
- Allow user to continue navigating through the application immediately

Never force the user to wait for post-submission processing to complete before they can continue using an application.
